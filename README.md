Mini http3 server

# Purpose
This project aims to create a light and reliable http/3 server. This is a personnal project and is far from operationnal. It's more a training for myself rather that a real project.

# Http/3
Http/3 is a transfert protocol used over UDP rather that TCP. It is still in draft state but aims to be faster and as much secure than Http/2
